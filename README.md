Here‚Äôs a **detailed `README.md` specifically for Semantic Release** that you can copy and paste into your repository to document your release workflow:

# üì¶ Semantic Release Setup

This repository uses **[Semantic Release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)** to **automate versioning** and **GitHub releases** based on conventional commit messages.

---

## üìã What Is Semantic Release?

Semantic Release automates:

- Version bumping (based on commit history)
- Generating and publishing changelogs
- Creating Git tags
- Creating GitHub Releases

**No manual versioning or changelog edits are needed.**

---

## üß† How It Works

Every time you push to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions triggers Semantic Release.
2. Semantic Release analyzes recent commit messages.
3. Based on the commit types (`feat`, `fix`, `BREAKING CHANGE`, etc.), it:
   - Bumps the version (major, minor, patch)
   - Creates a Git tag (e.g. `v1.2.3`)
   - Publishes a GitHub release with a changelog

---

## üèó Project Setup

### 1. Install Semantic Release and required plugins

```bash
npm install --save-dev semantic-release @semantic-release/npm @semantic-release/git @semantic-release/github
````

### 2. Add a configuration file

#### Option 1: `.releaserc.json`

```json
{
  "branches": ["main"],
  "plugins": [
    "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer",
    "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator",
    "@semantic-release/npm",
    "@semantic-release/github",
    "@semantic-release/git"
  ]
}
```

#### Option 2: `release.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
  branches: ['main'],
  plugins: [
    '@semantic-release/commit-analyzer',
    '@semantic-release/release-notes-generator',
    '@semantic-release/npm',
    '@semantic-release/github',
    [
      '@semantic-release/git',
      {
        assets: ['package.json', 'CHANGELOG.md'],
        message: 'chore(release): ${nextRelease.version} [skip ci]\n\n${nextRelease.notes}'
      }
    ]
  ]
};
```

### 3. Setup GitHub Action

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Semantic Release
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PERSONAL_TOKEN }}
        run: npx semantic-release
```

> üîê You must create a **GitHub Personal Access Token** and add it as a **secret** named `PERSONAL_TOKEN` in your repo.
> The token should have `repo` scope to push tags and create releases.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Message Guidelines

Semantic Release uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):

| Type                                         | Description      | Version Bump |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| `feat`                                       | A new feature    | Minor        |
| `fix`                                        | A bug fix        | Patch        |
| `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test` | Internal changes | No bump      |
| `feat!`, `fix!` or `BREAKING CHANGE:`        | Breaking change  | Major        |

**Examples:**

```bash
feat: add login page
fix: correct validation logic
chore: update dependencies
feat!: switch to new API endpoint
BREAKING CHANGE: response format changed
```

---

## üîÅ Resetting Version to 1.0.0

To manually reset the version:

```bash
# Optional: update package.json (not required by semantic-release)
npm version 1.0.0

# Delete all old tags
git tag -d $(git tag)
git push origin --delete $(git tag)

# Create new baseline tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Why is `package.json` not updated?

Semantic Release **does not update `package.json` by default** unless you include the `@semantic-release/npm` or `@semantic-release/git` plugin.

### Why is there no release even after a commit?

Check:

* Commit message format follows the convention
* It was pushed to the configured release branch (e.g., `main`)
* The action ran successfully and found new commits

### How to skip CI for release commits?

Semantic Release uses `[skip ci]` in its release commit messages to prevent CI loops.
